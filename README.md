# Turtle Fractals

This is a small program I wrote in Python 3.x that uses Turtle Graphics to draw different fractals.

Check my blog post about recursion and fractals [here](https://jcalvarezj.blogspot.com/2020/11/la-esencia-de-la-recursion.html) (content is in spanish)

## Execution

Open a terminal on the project's root and either execute `python main.py` or `python3 main.py`, according to your system.
